                <h3>Touch typing &#128517</h3>
                So , When I had started coding I was very slow because of my typing skills, and I had to actually use
                some of my brain power while typing.
                <div>Then I got to know about touch typing and started to learn it.</div>
                <div>Initially it took about 10 days to get to speed of 40 wpm and then in just 10 more days i got to 60
                    wpm .</div>
                <div>After 60 wpm I was satisfied and then I thought that its enough but I got another Idea</div>
                <div><span>Why not make lectures notes on laptop by typing .</span> And my next goal was to get 80 wpm
                    which i achieved in about 10 days</div>
                <div>As of now I am at 100wpm</div>
                <div>
                    The websites I used for typing are
                    <ul>
